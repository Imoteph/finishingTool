FinisherSC
=============
If you encounter any issue, please feel free to directly contact me at kklam@eecs.berkeley.edu

## Command to run the tool ##

Here is the command to run the tool:

	python finisherSC.py destinedFolder mummerPath
	
If you are running on server computer and would like to use multiple threads, then the following commands can generate 20 threads to run FinisherSC. 

	python finisherSC.py -par 20 destinedFolder mummerPath

## Input and output files ##

Note that it is assumed that you have "contigs.fasta" , "raw_reads.fasta" in the destinedFolder and mummerPath is your path to Mummer. Therefore, please rename the files in the destinedFolder if needed. For "finisherSC.py", the key output file is **improved3.fasta** in destinedFolder. 


## A sample test run ##
Here is an example run with the pre-installed data files and softwares(e.g. Mummer, Gepard) [You may go to http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kakitone/package.zip  to download the the whole package to have a quick test. But we note here that all data and softwares besides FinisherSC have their copyright belonging to their original authors. We provide the sandbox here for users' convenience only. Moreover, all the updates and versioning will be at GitHub page. Users are encouraged to git clone our project for later usage after they successfully go through the example run].

1. You may run the test cases as python finisherSC.py EcoliTestRun/ MUMmer3.23/
2. After the processing, take the file whose name is **improved3.fasta** in destinedFolder and this is your output file.
3. If you want to visualize the output against the reference, you can use software like Gepard.

## Options ##
a)Fast mode \[ -f True \] (e.g. for large and complex genomes , you may want to use this mode to get results faster; However, there will be a bit of computation vs quality trade-off if you want to use this mode; We suggest that you use this mode only when you got stuck in the standard mode): 

	python finisherSC.py destinedFolder mummerPath -f True 
[It means that you want to use the fast mode ]

b)Parallel mode. \[-par numberOfThreads\] You can now use -par 20 to run finisherSC on 20 threads. The command is 
        
	python finisherSC.py -par 20 destinedFolder mummerPath


c)Break down large contig file \[-l True\]. If your contigs.fasta is too big, then you want to use this option to break it down for alignment. 

	python finisherSC.py -l True destinedFolder mummerPath


d)Pick from previous jobs \[-p pickupFilename\] (e.g. you have got improved2.fasta but the cluster node timeout and you want to start from improved2.fasta instead of from scratch)

	python finisherSC.py destinedFolder mummerPath  -p improved2.fasta

e)Mapping between old contigs and new contigs \[-o referenceName_QueryName \](e.g. you want to know how the contigs from contigs.fasta are mapped to improved3.fasta )

	python finisherSC.py destinedFolder mummerPath -o contigs.fasta_improved3.fasta
[It will then output the alignment of improved3.fasta against contigs.fasta. The output will be shown in the terminal and in mappingResults.txt at the destinedFolder]

f)Help \[-h\]. You can always use -h to get the usage suggestion. 

	python finisherSC.py -h


g)There is an experimental improvement based on repeat phasing and the further improved file is improved4.fasta. An illustration of that part is given in Fig. 7 of http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6971 . To experiment with that, first run finisherSC.py as before. After that, you can issue the following command:

	python experimental/xPhaser.py destinedFolder mummerPath

h) There is also an experimental improvement resolving tandem repeat. The further improved file is tademResolved.fasta. To experiment with that, first run finisherSC.py as before. After that, you can issue the following command:

	python experimental/tSolver.py destinedFolder mummerPath


## Data files for experiments ##
We are using the benchmark datasets available online in PacBio DevNet. And we can run FinisherSC to process those data to completion. For (1, 2, 3), we use -par 20 option and run it on a server computer and we get them finished in a couple of hours to a day. For (4), we run without any options on a laptop and get it finished in a couple of minutes.

## Remarks ##
1. After passing through the finishingTool, it is advised to use a polishing tool(e.g. Quiver) to polish the improved contigs( i.e. improved3.fasta )
2. If you have problem running scipy.weave, try to remove ~/.python27_compiled
