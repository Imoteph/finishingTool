finishingTool
=============
If you encounter any issue, please feel free to directly contact me at kklam@eecs.berkeley.edu
My name is  Ka-Kit Lam. 

## Command to run the tool ##

Here is the command to run the tool:

	python finisherSC.py destinedFolder mummerPath
	
## Input and output files ##

Note that it is assumed that you have "contigs.fasta" , "raw_reads.fasta" in the destinedFolder and mummerPath is your path to Mummer. Therefore, please rename the files in the destinedFolder if needed. For "finisherSC.py", the key output file is **improved3.fasta** in destinedFolder. 


## A sample test run ##
Here is an example run with the pre-installed data files and softwares(e.g. Mummer, Gepard) [Please go to https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xjpt8xf5g1xf0ek/bGmZvt9Zfd to Download the EColi-Data set as test cases coz it is too big for GitHub].

1. You may run the test cases as python finisherSC.py EcoliTestRun/ MUMmer3.23/
2. After the processing, take the file whose name is **improved3.fasta** in destinedFolder and this is your output file.
3. If you want to visualize the output against the reference, you can use software like Gepard.


## Remarks ##
1. After passing through the finishingTool, it is advised to use a polishing tool(e.g. Quiver) to polish the improved contigs in improved2.fasta
2. If you have problem running scipy.weave, try to remove ~/.python27_compiled 
3. There is an experimental improvement based on repeat phasing and the further improved file is improved4.fasta. An illustration of that part is given in Fig. 7 of http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6971 . To experiment with that, first run finisherSC.py as before. After that, you can issue the following command:

	python experimental/newPhasing.py destinedFolder mummerPath
