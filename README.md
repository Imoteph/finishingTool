finishingTool
=============

## Command to run the tool ##

This is the command to do this post processing greedily

	python finisher.py destinedFolder mummerPath

To run a repeat aware version:

	python finisherSC.py destinedFolder mummerPath
	
## Input and output files ##

Note that it is assumed that you have "contigs.fasta" , "raw_reads.fasta" in the destinedFolder and mummerPath is your path to Mummer. The key output file is **improved2.fasta** in destinedFolder. 

Here is an example run with the pre-installed data files and softwares(e.g. Mummer, Gepard) [Please go to https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xjpt8xf5g1xf0ek/bGmZvt9Zfd to Download the EColi-Data set as test cases coz it is too big for GitHub].

## A sample test run ##
1. You may run the test cases as python finisher.py EcoliTestRun/ MUMmer3.23/
2. After the processing, take the file whose name is **improved2.fasta** in destinedFolder and this is your output file.
3. If you want to visualize the output against the reference, you can issue the command of python viewer.py. And you will obtain dotplots [in EcoliTestRun] of
	a) each contigs against the reference 
	b) the whole new set of contigs against the reference. 
	c) the whole original set of contigs against the reference. 


## Remark ##
Remark : after passing through the finishingTool, it is advised to use a polishing tool(e.g. Quiver) to polish the improved contigs in improved2.fasta
Remark2 : if you have problem running scipy.weave, try to remove ~/.python27_compiled 
Remark3 : if you want polishing to be done for the gaps, you can add polish at the end as follows:
             python finisher.py EcoliTestRun/ MUMmer3.23/ polish
